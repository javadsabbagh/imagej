ImageJ
===================
[ImageJ main website](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/download.html)

This project is copied straight from the main website of the ImageJ. As you may know there are several projects derived from ImageJ, like FIJI and another repo in Github. I like the original project most. Because, it is simple and i like to work directly on it.

I try to restructure and change the base code and form my project out of it. Any contribution is more than welcome.

Current version of copied source code is 1.51.  

I try to keep the main build structure which is based on ant, besides maven or gradle build systems.

As you see main project of imagej releases new versions regulary, and I try to patch these changes to this repository.

The ant utility (http://ant.apache.org/) will compile and run ImageJ using 
the build file (build.xml) in this directory. There is a version of ant at

set up to use the JVM distributed with the Windows version of ImageJ.
The README included in the ZIP archive has more information.
